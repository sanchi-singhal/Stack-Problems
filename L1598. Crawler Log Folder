https://leetcode.com/problems/crawler-log-folder/description/


1. Using for loops:


class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, logs: List[str]) -> int:
        m=0
        for i in logs:
            if(i=="../" and m>0):
                m=m-1
            elif(i[-1]=="/" and i[-2]!="."):
                m=m+1
        return m
        
 alternative: switch case can also be used in c/c++.
        
        
2. stack
